What does ECMA stand for?
    - European Computer Manufacturer's Association 

How was JavaScript started?
    - introduced in 1995 by Nescape Corporation to make web pages more dynamic

Why is it called Javascript?
    - during 90s, the dot-com boom had begun and Java was the hot new language. 
    - marketing ploy by Nescape

Brief history of JavaScript 
    Creation at Netscape
        - The first web browser with a graphical user interface, Mosaic, was released in 1993. 
        - Accessible to non-technical people, it played a prominent role in the rapid growth of the WWWW.
        - Developers of Mosaic then founded the Netscape corporation, which released Netscape Navigator, in 1994. This quickly became the most-used.
        - During these years, web pages were static, lacking the capability for dynamic behavior after the page was loaded in the browser. 
        - In 1995, Netscape decided to add a scripting language to Navigator. They pursued two routes to achieve this: collaborating with Sun Microsystems to embed the Java programming language, while also hiring Brendan Eich to embed the Scheme language.

        - Netscape management soon decided to devise a new language, with syntax similar to Java and less like Scheme or other extant scripting languages.
        - Although the new language and its interpreter implementation were called LiveScript when first shipped as part of a Navigator beta in September 1995, the name was changed to JavaScript for the official release in December.

    Adoption by Microsoft
        - Microsoft debuted Internet Explorer in 1995, leading to a browser war with Netscape.
        - On the JavaScript front, Microsoft reverse-engineered the Navigator interpreter to create its own, called JScript.

        - JScript was first released in 1996, alongside initial support for CSS and extensions to HTML. 
        - Each of these implementations was noticeably different from their counterparts in Navigator.
        - These differences made it difficult for developers to make their websites work well in both browsers.

    The rise of JScript
        - In November 1996, Netscape submitted JavaScript to Ecma International.
        - This led to the official release of the first ECMAScript language specification in June 1997.

        - The standards process continued for a few years, with the release of ECMAScript 2 in June 1998 and ECMAScript 3 in December 1999. Work on ECMAScript 4 began in 2000.

        - Meanwhile, Microsoft gained an increasingly dominant position in the browser market. By the early 2000s, Internet Explorer's market share reached 95%.
        - This meant that JScript became the de facto standard for client-side scripting on the Web.

        - Microsoft initially participated in the standards process and implemented some proposals in its JScript language, but eventually it stopped collaborating on Ecma work. Thus ECMAScript 4 was mothballed (stopped using).

    Growth and standardization
        = During the period of IE dominance in the early 2000s, client-side scripting was stagnant.
        - This started to change in 2004, when the successor of Netscape, Mozilla, released the Firefox browser.
        - Firefox was well received by many, taking significant market share from Internet Explorer.

        - In 2005, Mozilla joined ECMA International, and work started on the ECMAScript for XML (E4X) standard. 
        - This led to Mozilla working jointly with Macromedia (later acquired by Adobe Systems), who were implementing E4X in their ActionScript 3 language, which was based on an ECMAScript 4 draft.
        - The goal became standardizing ActionScript 3 as the new ECMAScript 4.
        - To this end, Adobe Systems released the Tamarin implementation as an open source project.
        - However, Tamarin and ActionScript 3 were too different from established client-side scripting, and without cooperation from Microsoft, ECMAScript 4 never reached fruition.

        - Meanwhile, very important developments were occurring in open-source communities not affiliated with ECMA work.
        - In 2005, Jesse James Garrett released a white paper in which he coined the term Ajax and described a set of technologies, of which JavaScript was the backbone, to create web applications where data can be loaded in the background, avoiding the need for full page reloads.
        - This sparked a renaissance period of JavaScript, spearheaded by open-source libraries and the communities that formed around them.
        - Many new libraries were created, including jQuery, Prototype, Dojo Toolkit, and MooTools.

        - Google debuted its Chrome browser in 2008, with the V8 JavaScript engine that was faster than its competition.
        - The key innovation was just-in-time compilation (JIT), so other browser vendors needed to overhaul their engines for JIT.

        - In July 2008, these disparate parties came together for a conference in Oslo. This led to the eventual agreement in early 2009 to combine all relevant work and drive the language forward.
        - The result was the ECMAScript 5 standard, released in December 2009.

What are the usefulness of JS?
        - JS make modern web applications possible
        - You can interact applications without doing a page reload for every action 

On which platforms is JS used?
        - web browsers
        - some databases such as MongoDB and CouchDB use JS as their scripting and query language
        - several platforms for desktop and server programming (Node.js)

Who invented it?
        - Brendan Eich 

How is the book structured?
    - The book contains three parts:
    - the first 12 chapters -> JavaScript language
    - next 7 chapters -> Web browser and the way JS is used to program them 
    - last 2 chapters -> Node.js 

What are the projects? 
    1. Delivery robot 
    2. a Programming language
    3. a platform game
    4. a pixel paint program 
    5. a dynamic website
