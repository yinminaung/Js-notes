// SHORT-CIRCUITING OF LOGICAL OPERATORS 


- && and || handles values of different types in a peculiar way 
- they will convert the value on their left side to Boolean type
    in order to decide what to do 
- Depending on the operator and the result of the converstion, they will 
    return either the original left-hand value or the right-hand value 


|| operator returns the original left operand when that can be converted to true and 
    and returns right operand when false 

e.g. console.log(null || "user") -> user 
e.g. console.log("Agnes" || "user") -> "Agnes"


&& operator returns the orginal left operand when that can be converted to false and returns the right 
    operand when the left operand is true.

e.g. console.log(null && "user") -> null
e.g. console.log("user" && null) -> null 


Another important property
    - the right operand is evaluated only when necessary. 

    - true || X -> no matter what X is, the result is true and X is never evaluated. 
    - false || X -> X is never evaluated. 

    - Python also have the same property.
