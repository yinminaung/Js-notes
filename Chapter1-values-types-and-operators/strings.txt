How does JS represent a string?
    - The String type represents textual data and is encoded as a sequence of 16-bit unsigned integer
    values representing UTF-16 code units. (UTF - Unicode Transformation Format)
    - This means we can specify 2**16 characters. 
    - Each element in the string occupies a position in the string. 
    - The first element is at index 0, the next at index 1, and so on. 

    - Since there are more than 2**16 characters, some characters(e.g. emojis) take two elements to combine 
    to one character. 
    - So the length of a string is the number of UTF-16 code units in it, which may not 
    correspond to the actual number of Unicode characters.

How are backtict-quoted strings useful?
    Backtick-quoted strings, usually called template literals, can embed other values. 
    e.g. `half of 100 is ${100 / 2}`
