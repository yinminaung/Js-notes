How many bytes does a number take? 
    - 8 bytes (64 bits)

How this represents numbers (integers and floats)?
    - with 64 bits, we can specify 18 quintillion (an 18 with zeros after it)
    - 2**64 = 18446744073709551616
    - but not all whole number less than 18 quintillion fit in a JS number. 
    - negative numbers and floating points have to be represented. 
    - The actual maximum whole number that can be stored is more in the range of 9 quadrillion(15 zeros);

By theory, how many numbers can you represent in a typical computer? (neglect other programs)
    - memory available = 4 GB = 4 * 10^9 bytes 
    - memory taken by a number = 8 bytes 
    - 5 * 10^8 numbers can be represented.
