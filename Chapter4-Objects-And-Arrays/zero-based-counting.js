// just my theory and thinking

/* Zero-based counting is very common in programming.
   It is used in counting the characters of a string or 
   elements in a array. 
*/

// So Why? 

// here is what i think

let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];

// In C programming language, 
// int arr[4] = {1, 2, 3, 4};

// In the memory, arr stores the address of the memory
//  of the first item in the array,
